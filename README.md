# renju-parallel

A Renju (連珠, 五子棋, Gomoku, Five in a Row) AI with a customized `heuristic Negamax` algorithm, written in `C++`.

Currently runs single-threaded, I'm working on the parallelization, pattern analysis and more to increase depth.

The game requires C++ compiler, PHP, a web server and some configurations to run.

A live version is hosted on: [https://yunzhu.li/apps/renju](https://yunzhu.li/apps/renju)
